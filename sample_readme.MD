#### _Project Name_ : E-Health record management system (ERMS)

#### Overview

Storing the medical data in cloud makes the treatment efficient by retrieving patient’s medical history from the database.This system provides an environment where patient’s records are stored and it will be referenced by the doctors to improve the efficiency of the treatment. This handles the medical history of each individual of the country and provides access to all registered hospitals to read or update the data. The hospital which accesses the database must be registered and must have got a license. The license number is used as a unique code to access the database. The details of the patients will be stored using Aadhaar Number and an identification number will be generated when the patient’s data are stored into the database for the first time after the implementation of the system. Whenever the patient go for a treatment, their medical data will be stored into the database using their identification number. For security reasons, any person who wants to view their data will be allowed only to read the data. They will not be given access to update the database. For hospitals to update the database they require the license number along with the identification number of the person whose record has to be stored.Wepropose a scheme to help enterprises to efficiently share confidential data on cloud servers using Hierarchical attribute based encryption algorithm. 

#### Technology used

We use Java programming language for the backend development. Jsp pages for the frontend development and animation with CSS files. Mysql is used for creating local database and aws used for online database
And web hosting. For developement purpose we used Netbeans 8.2 ide. And alot of help from Google and youtube. 


#### Usage

Active internet connection, cloud storage, connectivity , Aadhar card details.


#### Tracks used

1. Influence the mass
     As the idea reached to a mass population and gets benefited by it.

2. Revolutionary the smart world
     As the patients dont have to carry a bunch of precription and all the data can easily trackable by the people.


#### AWS Services Used

AWS services are used for storing the database and all execution can be perform easily. All the website deployment is also store to the server side(AWS)

#### Future scope

If the product is implemented and adopted by the society than in the near future it became a very easy task to track data for a perticular place and it became a helping hand for the society to fight with any perticular diseases and easy to track that data.
